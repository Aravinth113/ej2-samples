        Batch editing mode is used to send bulk request (add, update and delete) to Grid. You can start editing by double clicking
        a cell and can change cell value. Edited cell will be highlighted while navigating to next cell or any other row,
        so that you know which fields or cells has been edited.
    </p>
    <p>In this demo, batch editing is enabled by defining mode as `batch`.</p>

    <p>
        Grid features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use editing feature, we need to inject
        <code><a target="_blank" class="code"
        href="http://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/grid/api-edit.html">
        Edit
        </a></code> module using the <code>Grid.Inject(Edit)</code> method.
